                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project was a group school assignment completed in May 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of this project was to design and create a Content Based Image Retrieval system by applying both
                    image processing and machine learning techniques.

                <h3>
                    Project outcomes
                </h3>
                <p>
                    First, my teammates and I started the project by carrying out research on related topics. We looked into the 
                    methodologies or algorithms proposed by the other researchers to solve the same or similar problem. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, we derived and implemented a feasible solution for Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), which is 
                    a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that classifies the images using the following 3 types of features: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Color Moments (CM), which measures the mean and the standard deviation of each RGB colour component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Local Binary Pattern (LBP), which represents the image texture. It was computed using the MATLAB built-in 
                        method called "extractLBPFeatures".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), which represents the shapes of the objects within an image. It was 
                        computed using the MATLAB built-in method called "extractHOGFeatures".
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The diagram below shows how the system works overall.
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/1.png" alt="System">
                </div>
                <p>
                    To measure the model's performance, we computed the prediction accuracy and found that it achieves 0.81 or 81%
                    on average. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides, we manually tested the model's generalisation power using 4 new images. Below is a screenshot of the 
                    result.
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/2.png" alt="Result">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Finally, we evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of our Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Strengths:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                It accepts RGB images in any size.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It accepts unannotated images, which are images without any metadata such as captions and keywords.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Weaknesses:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                It does not accept grayscale images due to the usage of the Color Moments (CM) feature.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It is not invariant to image rotation due to the usage of the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and 
                                Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The dataset used for model training and testing was adapted from the 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification">
                        Intel Image Classification Dataset
                    </a>
                    . It contains a total of 2800 RGB images distributed in the following 4 categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Building
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Forest
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mountain
                    </li>

                <p>
                    In this project, I was responsible for writing the code to train and test the model. Below is a snippet of my 
                    codework, which was written using the MATLAB programming language.
